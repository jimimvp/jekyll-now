subtitle: "Extracting planning graphs by intrinsic motivation."
---

In this work we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm that is able to construct planning graphs while managing to use computational resources **efficiently**,
guided by **intrinsic motivation** in form of prediction error and measure of task improvement.
