As part of hackathon, we have noticed that the future of energy distribution networks are with small producers (via solar cells for example). The missing component is an exchange that makes it possible for producers to exchange energy for value, which we tried to make possible. With this, we have won 1st place on a Microsoft-organized hackathon Germany-wide.
