subtitle: "How can we account for uncertainty in zero-order trajectory optimizers?"
---

In this work we address the problem of efficient uncertainty estimation in zero-order trajectory optimization via the Cross Entropy Method (CEM).
Moreover, we show that it is essential that we can distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in order to avoid so-called "risky" behaviour.
