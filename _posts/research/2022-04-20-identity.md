subtitle: "No need for a solver call on the backward pass (sometimes)"
---
As a continuation of the blackbox-backprop line of work, we introduce a simple modification to the algorith, namely treating the solver as an identity mapping in the computation graph on the backward pass.
This, coupled with projections that avoid degenerate cases, works comparably well as `blackbox-backprop`.
