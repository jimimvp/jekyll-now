Hi, I am Marin, a PhD student at the <a href={{site.data.links.mpi}}> Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems </a> in Tuebingen, Germany as part of the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems. 
My thesis advisory committee consists of Georg Martius, Peter Dayan, Michael Muehlebach and Aamir Ahmad, with my primary supervisor being Georg Martius.
</p>

<p>
I possess a masters degree in computer science with a machine learning focus from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany and a bachelors degree in computer science from the University of Zagreb, Croatia.
</p>

<p>
In 2017 I was fortunate enough to have received a research fellowship with the Blue Brain Project in Geneva, Switzerland, 
where I came into contact with neuroscience.
In 2021 I spent some time at <b>Amazon</b> as an applied scientist intern doing work on variational inference, reinforcement learning and NLP in collaboration with Patrick Ernst and Gyuri Szarvas.
I spent part of 2022 at <b>DeepMind</b> hosted by Kimberly Stachenfeld in Peter Battaglia's group working on diffusion generative modelling for building better optimizers in close collaboration with Arnaud Doucet.
</p>


<p>
Regarding research, I have a broad interest in sequential decision making (RL etc.), representation learning, generative modelling and implicit layers. 
I am actively looking for collaborators! If you are interested, you can reach me at mvlastelica at tue dot mpg dot de. 
</p>

<p>
In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, reading opinionated books on various topics, and all sorts of sport activities.
