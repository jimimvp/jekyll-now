Hi, I am Marin, a PhD student at the <a href={{site.data.links.mpi}}> Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems </a> in Tuebingen, Germany as part of the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems. 
My thesis advisory committee consists of Georg Martius, Peter Dayan, Michael Muehlebach and Aamir Ahmad.
</p>

<p>
I possess a MS degree in computer science with a machine learning focus from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany and a BS in computer science from the University of Zagreb, Croatia.
</p>

<p>
In 2017 I was fortunate enough to have received a research fellowship with the Blue Brain Project in Geneva, Switzerland, 
where I came into contact with neuroscience.
In 2021 I spent some time with Amazon as an applied scientist intern doing work on variational inference, reinforcement learning and NLP.
</p>


<p>
    I have a broad interest in reinforcement learning, model predictive control and causality.
