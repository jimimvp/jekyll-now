Here I want to talk about **interest overflow**, which is somewhat connected with information overflow, but there is a subtle difference. I argue that the difference is the category of information the perceiver is receiving and his power over it. In everyday life, we are bombarded by various types of information. This can be ads, to get you to buy that laptop bag that you were looking at for the past few days (hm, maybe this is even useful? - debatable). For news sources we can go so far as to say that they steer our emotions, emotions of fear, happiness, sadness by various disturbing news about the events that are happening in the world today (stuff that you don't want to hear? - debatable).  Maybe you are reading this because of information overflow, or perhaps interest overflow (I hope the latter).

Interest overflow is different, it's a consequence of zooming in on a broad field within a specific topic. To give you an example, suppose you are in the fruit business and you want to start growing a specific type of fruit, that is going to grow well on the land that you have. You start reading about fruits, you start calculating profit margins and estimating demand in order to make the best decision - naturally. Then you start reading about pears, apples, oranges, the list keeps growing, you are reluctant to decide on one type of fruit, you want them all. It might be best for your business to focus on one, maybe two perhaps (debatable, I know nothing about fruit). Yet, this yearning for more information, somewhat of a natural curiousness is taking a toll on you, you want more.

It comes barely as a surprise that the previous paragraph is written by a PhD student. We, PhD students, have a very difficult task to tackle, we need to define our small part of the world where we will make a small meaningful contribution. So, you might say that having this acute condition, interest overflow, is quite bad if you want to focus on getting a PhD done. It is kind of playing against us, since PhD students are intrinsically curious mysterious creatures... I'll stop there, back to the mainline.

So, interest overflow, what gives? Straight to the punchline, I suspect the following culprits that are contributing (if you think this is bullshit, please stop reading and send me a constructive email with a strong opinion bashing the article):
* **Need for learning.** Not getting into the exact details, but for some unknown reason, you really want to learn, improve yourself.
* **Dilemma oh dilemma.** Dilemma is one of your favorite states of being, we'll discuss why later on. 

Let's deconstruct then the culprits. Ah, learning, the beauty of just feeling self-satisfied when finding out something new, having the feeling of improvement, being better than your previous self, boosting your ego a bit perhaps (I won't tell anyone). Yes indeed, learning is essential for us as a civilization to prosper. To be honest, I know a person, John Doe, who actually cries when he finds out something beautiful, it's almost a scene equivalent to seeing his/her father come out of the grave and give a hug. I wish I was like that, emotionally attached to novel facts with crying from happiness. Unfortunately, me, personally, I am not. I'm motivated by self-improvement and survival on this vial card-dealing die-throwing planet that assigns us our place in the world by an indifferent game of chance. Indeed, various motivating factors exist for the urge to learn, to improve ones self. What are yours?

Dilemma is the mother of all choices. Yes, dilemma... The typical countermeasure for alleviating the pressure of (sometimes irreversible) choice. A lot of times in my life I thought that keeping many doors open for myself is the best strategy. Alas, some decisions are better made with haste, otherwise you might end up spending extra energy to make them in order to come to terms with the conclusions that you might have made in the first place. This is in other words,
